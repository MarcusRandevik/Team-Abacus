Q1. Today I feel that I'm still lacking skills in both programming and understanding the 
different enviroments that we will use. I want to learn how to develop in an android-app invironment and continue to learn Github better. To do that, 
me Amanda Noa and Marcus will have a "crach course" in androidapp development to make us understand it better.
Q2. Today, we need to learn how to work as a team. I want our group to have a working scrumboard and to make everyone feel involved in the project. To do that
we need to sit down together and make a scructure and pick a scrum-master.
Q3.I want to learn how to split up the work in different tasks, and in the future have them in appropriate size to handle in 1-2 days. To do that, we need to continue reflect
upon how the split is working from development week 1.
Q4.I feel that i dont have  that much programming experience to develop an android app. In the future i want to be able to handle tasks by myself. To do that,
i need to learn from my team members and watch torturials.
