Q1. what do I want to learn or understand better?
 I hope to better  understand how to work in software projects over all, both how to construct a development environment and how to communicate between the members in the team. 
I haven’t used Github before and really want to learn how to navigate and use the website in an effective and useful way. 
Also, I will hopefully improve my programming skills as well. 

Q2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I hope I can help the team to allocate our resources in an effective way and to see each other's strengths and how everyone can be useful no matter what skills you have. 
I also want to spread positive energy and decrease the stress level by not setting unreachable goals. 

Q3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have  used Trello (as scrum board) a few times before and hopefully I can help the team get started in a good way and make sure that everyone understands how to use it. 

Q4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I want to develop my  programming skills so I want to learn how the IT-students work in these types of projects and how they write code in an effective way. 
It feels really exciting to work with this type of project!
