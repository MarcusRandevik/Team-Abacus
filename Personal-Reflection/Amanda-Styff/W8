Q1: I want to learn more about implementing features that are new to me. This week Noa, Izabell and I have worked on the substantial user story: “Dela lägenhet”. As we tried to implement a deep link it turned out to be more difficult than anticipated. However I found it very interesting as I use deep links in my everyday life but I have never actually coded something similar before. 

Q2: This week we have done a lot of trial and error and researching in order to make the deep link work. In cases like this I search the web in order to find possible solutions for us to try that might be helpful. In this way I can help someone else learn something new. 

Q3: As always, I have been involved in all parts of the project this sprint which includes planning, discussing, coding, and reflecting and reviewing. This sprint was very similar to the previous ones in terms of what had to be done during the week. Next sprint will be a bit different as it is the last one and we have to prepare a presentation of the project and start working on the final report. 

Q4: This sprint I have been involved in doing the user stories: Toggles info in  detailed apartment, Koppling mellan apartment och user and Dela lägenhet. The first two ones were quite small tasks that we were able to complete but the last one was as I mentioned before, more difficult than anticipated and we were not able to finish it this week. I think we are well on our way though, and we will most likely finish it in the beginning of the next sprint.
