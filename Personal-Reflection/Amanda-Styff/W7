Q1: Again, I want to keep learning more about programming in Android Studio and I want to make sure I understand all of the code we have written over the weeks. This week I was paired up with Noa and Lisa and on Wednesday we did a lot of javadoc which I found very educative. It was good to go over the code again to get a better overview of what we have done and how the different features actually work. I will keep doing this in the remaining sprints. 

Q2: Still, I think itâ€™s of great importance to stay active and inquisitive in order for me to help someone else learn something new. It is always very helpful to discuss different matters in groups, whether it is about the code, the scrum board, the team reflection or something else. 

Q3: I am still involved in all of the aspects of the project. We have a close communication so that everyone feels involved and can keep up with all of the user stories etc. This week I have been involved in planning the sprint, doing user stories, discussing and reflecting. 

Q4: As previously mentioned, I was paired up with Noa and Lisa for this sprint. We started out by doing the filtration so that the user can filter advertisements based on maximum rent, square metres and number of rooms. It was a little bit tricky in the beginning but with some guidance from Marcus we were able to make it work. After that we did some javadoc for all of the code which was a great learning experience.
