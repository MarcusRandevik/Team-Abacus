Q2: I will try my best to contribute with my thoughts and experience in order to benefit the team and the project.  

Q3: We have only just started working with Scrum. We have settled on three different KPIs and we have broadly decided the scope of the project. 

Q4: So far I have been engaged in the meetings we have had and in deciding on what our project should be and what to include in the social contract.
