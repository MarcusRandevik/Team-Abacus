Q1: After each sprint we have done I feel like I have learnt many new things especially on how to approach different programming issues when doing user stories. But at the same time I feel like I understand less each sprint because the complexity increases. I want to keep learning more and I will try my best to do so by staying active and keep asking questions. Fortunately we have a very good working environment within the team where asking questions is encouraged and everyone feels comfortable doing so. 

Q2: Again, I think it is important to stay active and ask questions when I donâ€™t understand something. When trying to come up with good strategies on how to solve tasks in Android Studio it can be very helpful to discuss the problem and what it actually is we want to achieve. Since we always do programming in small groups this is working very well and has been working well in previous sprints too. Therefore we will proceed with the same approach in upcoming sprints. 

Q3: I am still involved in all of the different aspects of the project. This week that includes planning the sprint, estimating the effort for different user stories, programming, keeping up with the KPIs and reflecting. If there is something I think the rest of the team has forgotten about I try to remind them. 

Q4: This week Izabell, Noa and I have worked on the user story: Skapa annons del 1. I found this to be quite a challenging task but at the end of the sprint we could deliver something useful that Lisa (our client) was happy with. The most difficult part was implementing a way of saving the user input so that an apartment ad could be saved and published in the list. We did a lot of research and consulted with the other team members and finally got it to work. I want to keep working on future user stories in small groups in order to maximize the learning outcome for everyone, and ensure high quality of the code.
