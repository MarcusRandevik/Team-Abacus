Q1: I want to continue learning about how to implement the Scrum framework. I also want to learn more about how to program using in Android Studio. 

Q2: I will continue to contribute with my thoughts and experiences and I will read up on relevant subjects such as Scrum and programming using Android Studio in order to benefit the team.

Q3: I have been involved in the learning and planning processes. I found the team exercise with Minetest very interesting and I think the whole team learnt a lot from it. I have also read a bit about Scrum in order to get a deeper understanding of how to implement it in our project. 

Q4: This week I have, together with the rest of the team, constructed a business model canvas for our project. I have also been involved in writing a description and designing the mockup. Also, Kerstin and I had a meeting with Lisa (our customer) in order to get her opinions on what the product should be.
