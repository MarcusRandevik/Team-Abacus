Q1: I would like to learn more about agile project management and how it can be implemented in larger projects in the future. I have learnt many new things during our project but the scope is relatively small and I think it would be interesting to use this agile approach in a more extensive project. We will be reflecting on this in the final report and hopefully we will gain some new insight that can be helpful in the future. 

Q2: Searching for alternative solutions to programming issues we have encountered has proved to be very helpful and in this way I can help someone else learn something new. As always it is also important to stay active and engaged and keep asking questions. 

Q3: In this sprint I have been involved in all aspects as usual. Since this was the final sprint it was a bit different from the previous ones in terms of what we have spent time on. This sprint we did more planning as we have a presentation on Monday and a final report to write. We also focused more on finalising the user stories we had left and making sure the product looks good and is user friendly. 

Q4:  This sprint I have worked on user stories together with Izabell and Noa. In the beginning of the sprint we finalised some user stories and worked on improving the design of the app. When we started the project a few weeks back we established responsibilities for all team members and I have a bigger responsibility for the final report, which I have started to prepare for during this sprint. We are aiming to finish the report during next week and I will try to make sure that we will.
