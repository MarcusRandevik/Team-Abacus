Q1: This week we have set up a working environment and we have completed some of our user stories. I want to learn more about working in Android Studio and programming in general. I also want to become better at planning and conducting sprints as a team effort. I think we did a good job with the first sprint and now we have a better idea of what tasks to do and how time consuming they will be. 

Q2: I will stay active and engaged in all parts of the project and provide insights and ideas I think would benefit the team and the project. In order to do this I will do some reading and ask my team if there is something I am wondering about. 

Q3: I have been active in planning the sprint, completing user stories, reflecting and discussing with the team. I think our team work is going very well and we will continue with the structure we have and our open discussions. I believe everyone feels involved in every aspect of the project even though we divide tasks between us and we will continue with that approach. 

Q4: When programming this week we sat together in smaller groups and this was very valuable as everyone has a different approach on how to solve things etc. including me. I can contribute with ideas and solutions to challenges that we encounter.  I think our communication is working very well and I feel confident asking questions whenever there is something I donâ€™t understand.
