Q1: I want to keep learning more about programming in Android Studio. This week was more challenging than the last but I feel like I’ve learnt a lot along the way. I like our approach of dividing user stories between us and programming in groups of two or three. It creates an environment where it is easy to discuss and learn. 

Q2: I think it’s important to stay active in all aspects of the project and try to learn as much as possible. I can contribute and help someone else learn something new by asking questions. A great way of learning something new is to explain it to someone else. 

Q3: This week I was Scrum Master and it was my responsibility to make sure we have meetings as agreed and that everyone feels involved. It has been a great experience even  though it was not very different from any other week since we have a very flat structure. 

Q4: This week I have been working on the user story “Se annons” together with Moa and I think we did a good job with it. Since I was the Scrum Master I was also responsible for writing up the Team Reflection after our meeting. As usual I have also been active in the other parts of the project as well i.e. planning, reflecting, discussing.
