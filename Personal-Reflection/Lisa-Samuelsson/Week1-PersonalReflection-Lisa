---- What do I want to learn or understand better? ----
During this course, I hope to learn more about the process of developing an application, and especially how to work productively as a group. During previous projects, the focus has been more on programming and less on the process itself, which I find sometimes has led to issues such as unrealistic expectations or unbalanced workload. I look forward to learning how working Agile could change the development process and even group dynamics. I hope that using KPI’s could provide insights in both the productivity and the wellbeing of the group. I am also hoping to get a better understanding of how to manage requirements from an external stakeholder.
 
 
---- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? ----
If I would have a good source on something, e.g. a youtube video that explains a technique, I will share that with the group. I will also be sure to share my knowledge in parts of the project that I have more experience in, for example UX design. 
 
 
---- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? ----
I have contributed by being active in the discussions about scrum. I also suggested that we could use Trello as a Scrum board later on in the process, to organize the process. 
 
 
---- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? ----
This week, we handed in the social contract. I have contributed by actively being part of discussions about what should be included. I looked up other social contracts to get inspiration, and shared the findings in discussions with the group.
