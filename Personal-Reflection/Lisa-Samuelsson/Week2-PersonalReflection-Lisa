--- What do I want to learn or understand better? ---
I want to get a better understanding of how to implement different roles when working with Scrum, 
for example Product Owner and Scrum Master, and to apply it to our project. I also want to learn 
more about how to develop for Android. 
 
 
--- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? ---
I have started reading about Android development and will share any useful links that I find. If 
my teammates have issues with something I will try to help them. If I don’t know much about the 
issue,  I can at least talk to them, because sometimes you simply need to discuss something with 
another person to understand it. 
 
 
--- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? ---
This week, we have had further discussions about how we will use Scrum, in which I have been 
actively participating.  I have also done some reading about Scrum to better understand it, and 
I hope to be able to share this knowledge with my teammates in the upcoming weeks.
 
 
--- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? ---
Throughout the week, I have been active in the group chat as well as in meetings when we have 
discussed the deliveries. I have helped create the mockup, the description of the project and 
the business canvas model.
