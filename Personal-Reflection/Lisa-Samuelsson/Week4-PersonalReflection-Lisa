--- What do I want to learn or understand better? ---
I want to learn more about how to build graphical user interfaces in Android studio and overall increase my 
understanding of how the architecture of an android app works. I hope to learn more about this next week in 
the upcoming sprint. 
 
 
--- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? --- 
When pair programming, I will share any knowledge I have learnt from previous courses and from my own research.
For example, I have not worked with GitKraken before, but am instead more experienced with using Git Bash, 
and if someone wants to improve their skills I could help share the knowledge I have. I think that our group's 
communication works really well, and this comes from the fact that we evaluate our team work and how we feel about
the project. I think that I can continue contributing to this also in the upcoming weeks by sharing what I have learnt
from previous group projects and my thoughts about our groups communication. 


--- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? --- 
We have started working more with Trello, and I have been active in discussions about how our scrum board should work. 
I have also contributed by reminding group members to fill in our Niko-Niko calendar (one of our KPI’s) so that it is 
up to date. 

 
--- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? --- 
I have been contributing to the team reflection by being active in discussions about what to include, and with my 
thoughts about this sprint. I I have contributed by sharing thoughts and opinions, and of course by listening to what
others have said. I have also been working with the project throughout the week, by pair programming and being active 
in meetings with the group, the stakeholder and our supervisor.
