what do I want to learn or understand better?
  - At the moment, my understanding of how the listener function works in xml is a bit limited, 
    and this is something that I want to gain more knowledge in, and to reach this goal,
    I plan on asking questions and to be apart of our development in this area. 
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  - What I can bring to the table in this matter is to maintain focus on what is valuable for our customer.
    This was obvious when we had a debate whether to keep developing functions or design, and my
    opinion made a difference in this scenario, and I believe by doing this, the group can become more
    focused on value-creating development. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  - This week, I was involved in using the scrum board on Trello a whole lot, and this is something 
    that I wish to be doing more of in the future. By dynamically and continously working with the team
    and our scrum board, I believe my contribution will be beneficial. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  - This week, as the week before, we did programming in pairs. This can be seen as the reason to why 
    I haven't made any commits, as this was done by either Lisa or Kerstin instead. Our assignment for this
    sprint was to develop the ability to create an apartment-ad, and this involved many obstacles and learning
    opportunities. In the future, I believe programming in pairs is beneficial and I will express my positive
    stance to make sure that this is implemented in the future.
    So this week, I was involved in 50 of the 100 points delivered.
