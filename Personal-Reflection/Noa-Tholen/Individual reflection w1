What do I want to learn or understand better?
  - Something that I would like to learn is to develop an Android application, which I can't at the moment. 
   I believe that we are going to develop our project in this way, and I want to understand it better. 
   Hopefully I have learnt this by the next few weeks!
   
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  - What I could bring to the table might be the business model canvas, as this is something I have prior experience of. 
  This is one of the first things that we are going to hand in, and I believe that my knowledge in this area might help the group. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  - I reminded the group that we should have a sprint time of 1 week periods. 
  This is to make sure that we can utilize the feedback opportunities we are given by the course, which makes for a better project.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  - I was the one who found the blueprint for our social contract, and also the one who handed it in, so at this moment I am responsible for all deliveries by the group! :)
