# Marcus Randevik Week 6 reflection
This was the third week which involved programming tasks. Overall, all teammembers now seem to be on track and have gained more knowledge regarding android developement. 

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I mentioned last week how I wanted to improve my understanding of testing code that interact with a lot of Android frameworks. Unfortunately this was something that had to be put aside as more effort needed to be spent on actually implementing the tasks that were assigned to me and help out the other teammembers when needed. A better goal would perhaps be to learn how to divide time between the different tasks (mentoring, implementation, testing, backloog grooming...) so that each one will provide the most value. This is also something that is highly relevant at my work where there are several paralell proceses going on, each needing some of my attention.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Although the other teammemberes have quite quickly adaped to Android developement, some regular mentoring / code sessions are still needed when they get stuck on a particular problem. I try to, as much as possible, give them time to describe their perspective of the problem, i.e what needs to be solved and the tools which might be the right fit, instead of just presenting a solution. A result of this might be that I point out knowledge gaps and potential resources which could help out, or simply provide only a partial solution and hint at what might be needed next.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I feel like my biggest contribution to our use of scrum relates to the tasks themselves. I put a lot of emphasis on the fact that each task must provide som value to the user and not only on us as developers. For example, a hardcoded user might be of great value for us as developers as it serve a simple purpose of giving us data to work with. But that same hardcoded user could also be shown in the interface to give the customer a quicker preview of how we expect things to look lik instead of having to wait before we've implemented the logic for handling a user in the backend. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
In much the same way as previous weeks, I've assigned myself to a core feature that involves a lot of new elements to be able to provide the rest of the team some guidelines for when they are later using that logic in other parts. This week that task was the displaying of pictures in the detailed view of an ad. Apart from coding, I've provided help when others have gotten stuck on a particular task.
