# Marcus Randevik Week 1 Reflection
This is the second time I participate in this course. The first time, which resulted in me not passing, was in 2016. Since then I've had a lot of time to practice both programming skills as well as more soft skills such as teamwork and software engineering in general. Also, since september 2020, I've been working at DocuSign where agile principles are practiced in all teams, though not nearly as much in my own team. Thus my goal of this course is to more actively apply and practice many of the agile principles that I wish to bring back to my team at work.


## What do I want to learn or understand better? 

My team at DocuSign handles much of the core infrastucture of our application, such as service descovery, persistent storage, API definitions. This means that we often have large tasks and not all to many user driven stories. These large tasks often result in big deliviers with a lot of risk. I would like to learn and better understand how one can deliver incremental value rather than all at once to decrease the risk of every project and speed up deliveries. 

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As I've spent more time in school as well as time working, I hope to be able to guide and help out the other teammembers with a lot of things concering the development. That is not to say I know it all, on the contrary I beleive that I have plenty to learn from the others both in terms of programming skills as well as in the area of customer contact.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I've been an active participant in all the teams gatherings and have so far been able to answer some of the questions the other teammembers have had when it comes to how Scrum may be applied.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

As mentioned above, I've been an active participant in all gatherings and have proposed new ideas.
