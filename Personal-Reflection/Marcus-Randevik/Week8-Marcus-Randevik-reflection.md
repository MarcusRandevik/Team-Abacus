# Marcus Randevik Week 8 reflection
This was the fifth week which involved programming tasks. The team how now begun implementing "non-trival" tasks and thus have gained experience from working the full stack of the application, from the database to external links. Overall we did not manage to bring as much value as was planned but I feel like this was a good lesson as we have to work with a lot of unknowns. 

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week I talked about learning how to better divide time between the differents parts of the project and a particular task or user story. This was somethings I practiced this week by initially planning much less time for the implementation and thus lowering the scope. As a result, I had more time to properly test and comment what I did as well as to help out the rest of the team without feeling "stressed". For the next week we have planned to do a lot of cleanup in the frontend, as this isn't somethings I have worked a lot with, there is plenty of room for improvement. 

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I'll try to as always be of assistance both in terms of code practices and implementation tasks as well as more general teamwork isues. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
In similar fashion to previous weeks, I helped other teammembers to properly scope their tasks so that they could deliver some value instead of none at all. One example of this was the issue of sharable links (deep links) that one grouped worked on. While they didn't have the time to implement a button for a user to actually get the link of an advertisement, they did manage to implent the backend to support links and thus enabled us to test the functionallity and show to the customer.   

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
In much the same way as previous weeks, I've assigned myself to a core feature that involves a lot of new elements to be able to provide the rest of the team some guidelines for when they are later using that logic in other parts. This week that task was the favourites page where a user can see all the advertisements that he/she has marked as favourite. Apart from coding, I've provided help when others have gotten stuck on a particular task.
