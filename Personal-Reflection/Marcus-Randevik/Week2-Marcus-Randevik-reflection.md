# Marcus Randevik Week 2 reflection
This week featured the famous lego exercise and also a seminar on slicing tasks.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Participating in the lego exercise for the second time didn't seem to give me much better results. Thus I must have forgotten much during the 4 years it been since I took this course. Learning how to deliver incremental value and smaller realeases is still my primary goal. I feel like this is something that I'll get to test during the "regular" weeks ahead.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We've planned to get set up with the project environment during the next week. As I have some experience with android development from before, I'll try to be as much of assistance to the other teams members for much of the week.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
During the lego exercise, I empashised the importance of talking to ur customer early on as well as setting up communication channels to the rest of the teams. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've participated actively towards or overall design of the application by suggestion ideas and potential references as well as actually making some of the design in our wiremock tool.
