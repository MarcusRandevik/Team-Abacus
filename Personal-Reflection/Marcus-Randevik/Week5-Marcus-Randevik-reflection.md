# Marcus Randevik Week 5 reflection
This was the second week which involved programming tasks. My main responsibility has been to support
the other teammembers in the implementation of their tasks. 

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have now established the base of our architecture. As it includes a lot of android framworks it's not all
to obvious have to best implement tests that cover much of our code. This is something that I want to better understand duing the comming week.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I'll continue to support the other teammembers by providing feedback on thier code and by showcasing how things can be
implemented. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've further contributed to the slicing of tasks so that they are more independant of eachother and may be implemented in parallel.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution this week is much the same as the previous week. I've implemeted a core feature relatively fast and
also helped the other members when implementing their task.
