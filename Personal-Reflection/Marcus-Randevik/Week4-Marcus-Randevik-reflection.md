# Marcus Randevik Week 4 reflection
This was the first week that we did "actual" programming and thus started to deliver value to our customer. 

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to better understand how to properly architecture an android app. This has been somewhat of a struggle for me in the past as
android development includes the usage of a lot of framworks that you have to use and thus have to read very much in order to
understand how to best design the app.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I delivered a first feature on tuesday so that the rest of the team could get an overview of how an andorid app is built,
from the front-end to the backend. This proved useful as the rest of the members could continue to build upon this instead of
reinventing the wheel each time.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I managed to help some of my team members to better slice the tasks that they had. An example would be to initially use hardcoded values when
developing the front-end. I also pushed for us to estimate tasks using scrum poker so that everyone
could have the ability to provide input on the effort of a tasks.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My main contribution was the completion of our first feature on tuesday. This enabled me to guide the other teammembers on where to place
and write code so that it best fit within the intended design.
