# Marcus Randevik Week 8 reflection
This was the sixth week and last which involved programming tasks. Overall we focused mostly on polishing the app for the final release and delivery. 

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Going in to this week, I wanted to learn more about creating user friendly interfaces as we decided to do some cleanup for this week. I managed to get some time with the other members whom have more experience with frontend. This was very valueable and will help me evolve as a full stack developer. 

Going forward I'd like to learn how to incorporate much of what I "relearned" during the course and how to apply it when developing professionally. 

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
During the course, I feel like I've helped the team get some experience for how development is done professionally. This often differs quite a lot from how ordinary programming courses are performed in school where the scope is very limited and often does not rely on many frameworks. I've introduced practices such as code reviews to help everyone get accustomed to having their code being read before merged. In addition, I've tried to help out whenever someone has been stuck on a specific task. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
In similar fashion to previous weeks, I helped other teammembers to properly scope their tasks so that they could deliver some value instead of none at all. I've performed code reviews and provided feedback on the works of others. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Much of my contributions this week has been to finiliaze the documentation to be "delivery-ready".
