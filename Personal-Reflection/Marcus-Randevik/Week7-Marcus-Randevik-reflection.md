# Marcus Randevik Week 6 reflection
This was the forth week which involved programming tasks. The team have now greatly improved our velocity and have thus finished more tasks compared to previous weeks. 

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week I discused the fact that dividing time between the different tasks involved in the project (mentoring, coding, testing..) is a difficult issue.  The fact that one should not spend more than 20 hours (which is a very strict deadline for me as I have a fulltime job and a family to take care of) makes it very apparemnt that time is limited and you always have to priritize which is more important. So far, mentoring and coding has been the top priority and thus testing and other tasks have been assgined less time. While this approach might work in the short run of this course, it would perhaps be better long term to do more tests that could help verify code quality automatically over time. Thus next week I want to assign an entire day to writing tests and document some of my previous code.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Though I have continuously provided the other teammemberes with help if needed, they have now gained even more knowledge and thus may ask me more specific question about the differences between two methods of implementing a solution. As a result, I've now provided more help to find the right resources rather than providing code.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week I tried to make sure the team put more emphasis on process improval in our sprint retrospective. Once such topic that was discussed a bit more was the fact that we are still doing much of our work in larger groups, thus not utilzing the full potential of parallelzing work now that we have a larger code base and thus may not always work in the same file. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
In much the same way as previous weeks, I've assigned myself to a core feature that involves a lot of new elements to be able to provide the rest of the team some guidelines for when they are later using that logic in other parts. This week that task was the displaying of pictures in the detailed view of an ad. Apart from coding, I've provided help when others have gotten stuck on a particular task.
