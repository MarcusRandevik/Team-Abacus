What do I want to learn or understand better?

	I see two main outcomes from this course that I look forward to learn more about.
	The first one is how to realize a group project with more focus on a sustainable working environment, since when it comes to earlier school projects it often only focus on the final product and not so much the group work, so I think I have a lot of methods to learn about this which is useful for a sustainable future.
	The other is how to conduct an Android application. We decided to do this based on the theme of our idea and since I have not done a Andorid application before I am now happy to probably learn how to.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

	I believe it is important to encourage questions and having an working environment where it is accepted to ask questions and discuss other soultions etc to increase the total learnings. I can contribute to this by being a part of a friendly and forgiving environment in the group. 
	Since we all come with different previous learnings I will make sure to tell about my knowledge in different areas where I believe it could benefit the project.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

	I suggested to have a recurrent time for online meetings, since it is hard week by week find a time that fitts seven individuals.  
	For our last session this week I made a list of what we should accomplish, so we did not forget anything we had said we should do this week. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

	I were involved during our sessions and discussed, wrote and came with idéas. 
	I came with the proposition to, even though we already had handed in our socail contract, we should discuss which KPIs we want to use, add it to the contract and then send it in again, to make sure to not forget/postpone decide KPIs.
