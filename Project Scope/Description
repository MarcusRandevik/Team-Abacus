We will develop an Android-app, where you as a student can find another student to switch apartments with, if you both live in a SGS student accommodation. This could be useful if a student would like to try out another area of Gothenburg, or if they need more/less square meters. The platform gathers all exchange possibilities, and there students can find each other. Contact can then be made between the two or three parties/users, and they can apply on the SGS website as usual, as we don’t facilitate the exchange process itself. The app’s purpose is to make for an even playing field for students looking for a switch in accommodation, and makes it a smooth process having all options at one place. Our stakeholder is Lisa, who wanted to find a solution for switching SGS apartments in a better way.
