# DAT257 Team Abacus - ChangeIt
Welcome to Team Abacus's project - ChangeIt

# About
ChangeIt is an Android-app aimed at students living in SGS student accomodation that wants to change apartments with another student.

In the app, one student can find another student to switch apartments with, if they both live in a SGS student accommodation.
This could be useful if a student would like to try out another area of Gothenburg, or if they need more/less square meters. 

The platform gathers all exchange possibilities, and contact can then be made between the two or three parties/users. They can then apply on the SGS website as usual, as we don’t facilitate the exchange process itself. 

The purpose of the app is to make it easier for students looking for a switch in accomodation, and to make the process smoother by gathering all options in one place. 


Our stakeholder is a student named Lisa, who wanted to find a better solution for switching SGS apartments.
